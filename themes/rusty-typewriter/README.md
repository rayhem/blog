## Configuration

The theme offers extensive configuration options through your site's `config.toml` file. Here are the main settings:

  sidePane = true
  countPageItems = 7

[params.rtwt.home]

```toml
+++
title = "Your Post Title"
date = "2024-03-28"
tags = ["tag1", "tag2"]
topics = ["topic1"]
my_taxonomies = ["value"]
featured = true
+++
```

## Customization

### CSS Customization

You can customize the theme's appearance by creating a custom CSS file:

1. Create `assets/css/custom.css` in your site
2. Add your custom styles
3. The theme will automatically include your custom CSS
4. You may take a look at `_root.css` for existing theme values and variables

> If a css file starts with an undescore (_), it will be bundled with the theme default ones, which may affect caching behavior!

### Layout Customization

The theme's templates can be overridden by creating corresponding files in your site's `layouts` directory.
