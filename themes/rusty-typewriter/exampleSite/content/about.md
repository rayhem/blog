# About

> Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

Rusty-Typewriter is a theme for Hugo sites made by [math-queiroz](https://github.com/math-queiroz). It's intended to be simple and used for blogs, being mostly inspired by the current [Zen Browser's website](https://zen-browser.app/) in style and other Hugo themes in functionality. It was initially intended for personal use but was made public for anyone who finds it worth using.
